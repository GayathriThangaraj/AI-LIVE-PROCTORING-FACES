A simple real-time head position and distraction detection system built using Flask and OpenCV. The system checks if the userâ€™s face is visible and whether they are distracted by looking away. Alerts are displayed in real-time via a web interface.

How It Works
   The system detects faces using Haar Cascade.

   If no face is detected, an alert "No face detected" is shown.

   If multiple faces are detected, it shows "Multiple faces detected".

   This is useful for online exams or proctoring environments where only one focused user should be present.
